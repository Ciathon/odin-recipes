# odin-recipes
Self-reflection to occur at end of assignment.
In all honesty, is was a bit confusing in the beginning. However, once I compeleted the first recipe link, I was able to understand the process of creating the html files and commiting to GitHub a bit better
What have I learnt:
    - Keep your files neat and it'll be easier to          understand their flow.
    - If you aren't sure of what you've done differently, refer back to a file which has been completed already for guidance.
