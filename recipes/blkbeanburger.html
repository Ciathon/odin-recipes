        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>These veggie burgers are packed with protein, a nutrient that is often lacking from a vegetarian diet. But of course, you donâ€™t have to be a vegetarian to enjoy these! Oozy mozzarella, punchy balsamic onions and a tangy, crunchy slaw make this dish a weeknight staple, and you can whip it up in under an hour.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>0.5 red onion</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar</li>
            <li>1 fresh red chilli</li>
            <li>2 spring onions</li>
            <li>1 x 400 g tin black beans</li>
            <li>100 g fresh breadcrumbs</li>
            <li>1 lemon</li>
            <li>extra virgin olive oil</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons natural yoghurt</li>
            <li>80 g baby kale</li>
            <li>30 g rocket</li>
            <li>olive oil</li>
            <li>1 ripe beef tomato</li>
            <li>75 g mozzarella cheese</li>
            <li>2 wholemeal buns</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Peel the onion, finely slice into rounds and place in a small bowl with the balsamic and a pinch of sea salt. Set aside.</li>
            <li>Halve, deseed and finely chop the chilli. Trim and finely chop the spring onions. Place both in a mixing bowl. Drain the beans and pat dry with kitchen paper. Add to the bowl, along with the breadcrumbs.</li>
            <li>Season, then scrunch the bean mixture together with clean hands. Divide into 3 balls, flatten into patties and place 2 in the fridge to chill for 10 minutes (wrap and freeze the spare for another day).</li>
            <li>In a small bowl, combine half the lemon juice, 1 tablespoon of extra virgin olive oil and the yoghurt. Season well. Trim the kale and mix into the dressing with the rocket. Put aside.</li>
            <li>Heat 1 tablespoon of olive oil in a non-stick pan over a medium heat. When the pan is hot, fry the burgers for 4 minutes on each side, or until golden. If they colour too quickly, reduce the heat.</li>
            <li>Slice the tomato and mozzarella into rounds and open the buns.</li>
            <li>When the burgers are almost cooked, top each one with mozzarella. Cover the burgers with a lid for 2 minutes to melt the cheese.</li>
            <li>Set another pan over a high heat and warm the bun halves, cut-side down, for 2 minutes or until toasted.</li>
            <li>Lift the onions out of the balsamic with a fork.</li>
            <li>Pop slices of tomato on each bun base, and a burger on top. Top with the balsamic onions and the bun lid. Serve the kale salad alongside.</li>
        </ol>
